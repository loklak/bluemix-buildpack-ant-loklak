Bluemix buildpack for Loklak: Java (with Apache Ant)
===================================================

This is an external[bluemix buildpack](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cfapps/byob.html) made specifically for the [Loklak server](https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server). Forked from https://github.com/aneeshd16/heroku-buildpack-ant-loklak (Thanks!)
It uses Apache Ant 1.9.3 to build your application and OpenJDK 1.8.0_51 (currently) to run it.

This buildpack is being used for the direct one button deployment of loklak to IBM Bluemix
